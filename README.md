# Taco recipe generator

> A python script that uses the api that [evz](https://github.com/evz/) made

## What it does

This python script gets a random taco from the api and shows you all of its parts in the terminal.

If you like what you see you can save the recipe (for each part) in one file.

## Credits

The API was made by [evz](https://github.com/evz/)
And the great idea came to life thanks to [sinker](https://github.com/sinker/)
